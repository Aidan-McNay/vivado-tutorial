Adding Block Designs
==========================================================================

Many FPGA tools additionally come with their own libraries of IP that
users can include in their designs. In Vivado, these are known as
**block designs**. Block designs include some helpful hardware, such as
protocol adapters, as well as other resources like clock generators.

.. admonition:: Board Dependency
   :class: warning

   The resources available will largely vary between boards; accordingly,
   this section is board dependent. If you have another board, not all
   of the same IP blocks will be available

Here, we'll change the frequency of our clock to slow down our counter
a bit from the default of 50MHz

Creating a Block Design
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here, we'll create a new collection of IP to generate a slower clock.

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: GUI

       First, start by creating a new block design

       .. admonition:: Creating a Block Design
          :class: important

          On the left, in **Flow Navigator**, under **IP Integrator**,
          select **Create Block Design**:
          
          * Name the design ``clk_gen``
          * Have the directory be the default ``Local To Project``
          * Keep the default source set of ``Design Sources``

       This will open up the **Block Design** window, with a few
       new tabs:

       * **Design**: The design hierarchy of our block design
       * **Diagram**: A visual block diagram of the design

       Next, let's add some blocks!

       .. admonition:: Adding IP
          :class: important

          In the **Diagram** tab, click the **+** icon or right-click and
          select **Add IP**. Search for "Clocking Wizard", select the
          result, then click Enter to instantiate it. Repeat this process
          to instantiate a "ZYNQ7 Processing System" and a "Processor System
          Reset". When you instantiate the former, a banner will appear
          titled "Run Block Automation"; click on this, and run the
          automation, ensuring that **Apply Board Preset** is checked.
          This will create ``DDR`` and ``FIXED_IO`` connections; this
          is expected. See :doc:`appendices/processing_system` for more
          details.

       In the **Diagram** tab, you can now see a block diagram of our new
       IP blocks. Additionally, our hierarchy in the **Design** tab has
       been updated.

       Let's make some connections between these two!

       .. admonition:: Connecting IP
          :class: important

          In the **Diagram** tab, hover over the ``FCLK_CLK0`` pin of the
          ZYNQ7 Processing System, then click and drag to start making a
          connection. Drag this close to the ``clk_in1`` pin of the
          Clocking Wizard; once you get close, Vivado will recognize
          that ``FCLK_CLK0`` is a clock output, and ``clk_in1`` is a clock
          input, and will snap to that connection. Release your mouse to
          connect the two, then repeat to connect the following pins:
          
          * ``FCLK_RESET0_N`` of the processing system to ``reset`` of
            the clocking wizard and ``ext_reset_in`` of the system reset
          * ``M_AXI_GP0_ACLK`` of the processing system to ``FCLK_CLK0``
            of the processing system (just to avoid errors later on)
          * ``clk_out1`` of the clocking wizard to ``slowest_sync_clk``
            of the system reset
          * ``locked`` of the clocking wizard to ``dcm_locked`` of the
            system reset

       We now need to customize our clocking wizard to get our
       desired frequency.
       While we could directly edit the block's configurations in
       the **Properties** window, it's far more clear to edit them with
       the **Customize Block** tool.

       .. admonition:: Customizing Our Block
          :class: important

          In the **Diagram** tab, click on the Clocking Wizard, then click
          the wrench icon, or right-click and select "Customize Block":

          * Under "Clocking Options", under "Input Frequency", switch from
            "Auto" to "Manual", then set it to 50MHz (the frequency of
            ``FCLK_CLK0`` from the processing system)
          * Under "Output Clocks":

             * Change the output frequency of ``clk_out1`` to 10MHz
             * At the bottom, change the reset type to "Active Low"

          * Click **OK**

       Finally, we need to create the external interface for our design!

       .. admonition:: Adding Ports
          :class: important

          Right-click in the **Diagram** tab, then click **Create Port**
          (note that **Create Interface** port would allow us to create
          a particular kind of interface/bundle of signals, if we wanted)

          Name the port ``clk_10mhz``, make the direction **Output**, and
          make the type **Clock**. Click **OK**

          This should create a new pin in the block diagram. Connect it to
          ``clk_out1`` of the Clocking Wizard. Repeat this process to
          create an output named ``reset_10mhz`` connected to ``mb_reset``
          of the system reset

       At this point, our block design is finished! It should look like
       this:

       .. image:: img/clk_gen_block_diagram.png
          :width: 80%
          :align: center

       Vivado does not automatically save block designs for us (notice
       the star in the upper-left hand corner); do so either with
       ``Ctrl+S`` or **File -> Save Block Design**

       .. admonition:: Finishing Up
          :class: important

          There are a few last things we want to do to finish up our
          block design:

          * **Validation**: Vivado can help validate our block design,
            to try and catch any obvious mistakes. Click on
            **Tools -> Validate Design**. You should hopefully get that
            validation was successful!
          * **Generation**: We additionally need to generate the design
            files for our block design. On the left-hand side, in
            **Flow Navigator**, under **IP Integrator**, click on
            **Generate Block Design**. Click **Generate** in the pop-up.
            Vivado will think for a bit, then click **OK** when it's done.

       The design files have now been generated for our design! If you go to
       the **Sources** window, under our ``CLK_gen`` block design, you should
       now see ``CLK_gen.v``, which is the Verilog interface for our design.
       Examining the ``CLK_gen`` module (although it's a little messy), you
       should find two output ports, an output signal named ``clk_10mhz``, and
       an output signal named ``reset_10mhz`` (as well as the ``DDR`` and
       ``FIXED_IO`` ports); these are our generated signals!

       After these steps, our block design will need to be saved again, then
       you can click the **X** in the top-right hand corner to close the
       block design and return to the normal view.

    .. group-tab:: TCL

       .. admonition:: Creating A Block Design
          :class: important

          Either from **Tools -> Run Tcl Script** or from the command
          line (shown below), run the ``make_clk_gen.tcl`` script

          .. code-block:: bash

             vivado -mode batch -source ../scripts/block_design/make_clk_gen.tcl

          Inspecting this Tcl script, we can see that most of what it does is
          call another script named ``CLK_gen.tcl``. This script was dumped by
          Vivado; after creating the block design in the GUI (with the block
          design open), I used **File -> Export -> Export Block Design** to
          export the entire design as a Tcl script. This allows anyone else
          to perfectly recreate the design by running that script, and can
          be a great way to share block designs.
          
          The default script does check
          and fail if you're using a different version of Vivado (to ensure
          compatibility), but if you're using a later version, it's probably
          safe to remove this check.

Connecting to Our Design
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use our block design, we can instantiate it like any other RTL module.
Let's create a top-level file to connect our block design and gray code
module!

.. admonition:: Creating a Top-Level File
   :class: important

   Create a new design source file (either with your preferred code editor,
   or through the Vivado GUI with **File -> Add Sources**, choosing a
   design source, and "Create File") named ``top.sv`` with the following
   content (including connections for the ``DDR`` and ``FIXED_IO`` ports;
   see :doc:`appendices/processing_system` for more details):

   .. code-block:: sv

      // =======================================================================
      // top.sv
      // =======================================================================
      // Our top-level design file
      
      module top (
        output logic       en,

          .gray_count (gray_count)
        );
      
      endmodule

   If you didn't create the file through Vivado, follow the steps from
   :doc:`sources` to add it as a design source.

   Vivado should now reorganize the design hierarchy in the **Sources**
   window to show ``top`` as the top-level module, additionally shown by
   bolding it. If you ever wish to manually change/identify the top-level
   module, you can do so by clicking the gear icon to access the project
   settings.
