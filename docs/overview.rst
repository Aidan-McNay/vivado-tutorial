.. admonition:: Vivado Version
   :class: warning

   This tutorial was created for Vivado 2019.2 on Linux. The high-level
   workflow (and likely all GUI commands) will hold for future versions,
   but the exact Tcl commands may change, especially based on paths if
   you are using Windows instead of Linux.

Welcome! This tutorial aims to familiarize you with Vivado Design Suite,
as well as take you through the process of completing a design from
inception to implementation on an FPGA.

This tutorial will instruct you to run some command-line arguments; when
doing so, they will be in the following format (users should omit the
``%``, which is used to denote a command):

.. code-block:: bash

   % echo "Hello, Vivado Tutorial User"

This tutorial assumes that:

* You have access to Vivado Design Suite
* You have previous experience with RTL Design
* You have access to a Xilinx FPGA Board. This tutorial will assume
  a `ZYBO Z7-10 Board <https://digilent.com/shop/zybo-z7-zynq-7000-arm-fpga-soc-development-board/>`_\ ,
  as it's what is planned for Cornell's ECE department, but the
  walkthrough can be adapted for other platforms, and will mention
  what steps are board-dependent

.. admonition:: Use on ECELinux
   :class: info

   Cornell ECE students have access to Vivado Design Suite through
   ECELinux (as of time of writing). This is done by first loading
   the ``xilinx`` module:

   .. code-block:: bash

      % module load xilinx

   From there, Vivado can be opened simply with

   .. code-block:: bash

      % vivado

   Note that this requires a graphical connection; this can be done
   through X11 Forwarding, using a workstation in Phillips 314, or
   a separate application like

   * Microsoft's Remote Desktop (preferred)
   * `MobaXTerm <https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/>`_
   * `X2Go <https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php>`_

When the tutorial asks you to perform an action, it will be in a green
box like the following:

.. admonition:: Example Task
   :class: important

   This is a task you should do! (well, not really in this case)

Finally, many of the tasks we'll do with Vivado can be done through the
GUI, but can also be scripted with a `Tcl script <https://docs.amd.com/r/2021.2-English/ug835-vivado-tcl-commands/Revision-History>`_\ ,
which Vivado can use to automate commands. While the tutorial won't
go over scripts for each of these actions, it will provide them if
you wish to examine/use them. Tasks that have this option will have
a corresponding toggle button above them, shown below:

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: GUI

       .. admonition:: Example Task
          :class: important

          This is a task to be run in Vivado's Graphical User
          Interface (GUI)!

    .. group-tab:: TCL

       .. admonition:: Example Task
          :class: important

          This is a task to run actions with a Tcl script!

The GUI and Tcl commands are entirely interchangeable, so you can switch
between them at any time. In general, Tcl scripts are run with:

.. code-block:: bash

   vivado -mode batch -source /path/to/script.tcl

They can also be run from Vivado's GUI (``Tools -> Run Tcl Script...``);
scripts not run from an open project will have to open the project
themselves (look at scripts that edit a project for an example).

Finally, if you wish, you can step through commands in a Tcl shell with

.. code-block:: bash

   vivado -mode tcl
